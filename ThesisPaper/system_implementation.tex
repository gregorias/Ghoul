\chapter{Ghoul implementation}
\label{ch:implementation}
In this chapter we present Ghoul's prototype implementation.
This prototype includes the Kademlia protocol, registration, and certificate
security mechanism.
The prototype does not include the SybilControl protocol.
We focus on general techniques used in Ghoul's development to produce high
quality code.
In Section \ref{sec:implementation} we present main classes and architecture.
As an example of our design principles, we present the interface of
\texttt{KademliaRouting} --- the core interface in the protocol --- in more
detail.
In Section \ref{sec:build} we present build tools used and an example session
with Ghoul.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

\subsection{DHT part}

An UML class diagram showing core classes of the DHT part of Ghoul is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:dht_class_diagram}.

\begin{figure}[tbp]

\caption{UML Class Diagram of core classes of the DHT part of Ghoul}
\label{fig:dht_class_diagram}.
\end{figure}

The core interface of the protocol is \texttt{KademliaRouting} (whose code is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:routing_interface}).
Implementations of this interface should implement the Kademlia protocol with
Ghoul extensions.
One of the focus of Ghoul's code is modularizabilty and \texttt{KademliaRouting}
is an example of that focus.
First, \texttt{KademliaRouting} is an interface, although there is only one
implementation of it in the public part of the library's code
(\texttt{KademliaRoutingImpl} shown in Figure \ref{fig:dht_class_diagram}).
However, because it is an interface it is possible to easily mock it in
unit-tests.
\texttt{KademliaRouting} has another implementations in unit-testing code, e.g.
\texttt{StaticKademliaRouting}, which has a static routing table.
This allows creation of proper, isolated unit-tests that test non-trivial
scenarios and do not depend on complex, error-prone dependencies.
Second, \texttt{KademliaRouting} does not implement storage functionality.
Storage is done by the \texttt{KademliaStore} class, which depends on
\texttt{KademliaRouting}.
Such division of responsibilities is also an example of the single
responsibility principle --- one class should have only one responsibility.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
\begin{lstlisting}
public interface KademliaRouting {
  /**
   * Find size number of nodes closest to given {@link Key}.
   *
   * @param key key to look up
   * @param size number of nodes to find
   * @return up to size found nodes
   */
  Collection<NodeInfo> findClosestNodes(Key key, int size) throws InterruptedException,
      KademliaException;

  /**
   * @return hosts present in the local routing table.
   */
  Collection<NodeInfo> getFlatRoutingTable();

  /**
   * @return Key representing this peer
   */
  Key getLocalKey();

  /**
   * @return is kademlia running.
   */
  boolean isRunning();

  /**
   * Registers neighbour listener which will receive notifications about newly added nodes.
   *
   * @param listener listener to register
   */
  void registerNeighbourListener(NeighbourListener listener);

  /**
   * Unregisters neighbour listener if any is present.
   */
  void unregisterNeighbourListener();

  /**
   * Connect and initialize this peer.
   */
  void start() throws KademliaException;

  /**
   * Disconnects peer from network.
   */
  void stop() throws KademliaException;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{\texttt{KademliaRouting} interface}
\label{fig:routing_interface}
\end{figure}

{\texttt{KademliaRoutingImpl}'s constructor} is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:routing_constr_header}.
This constructor shows dependencies of \texttt{KademliaRoutingImpl}.
Functions such as: discovering current internet address
(\texttt{NetworkAddressDiscovery}), sending messages to given network address
(\texttt{MessageSender}), background thread execution
(\texttt{ScheduledExecutorService}), are realized by interfaces.
Dependence on interfaces allows custom definition of those functionalities by
the user.
Providing all dependencies in class' constructor is a realization of yet another
principle called dependency inversion --- dependencies of objects should be
provided to those objects not created by them.
Again, the biggest strength of such approach is mostly visible in unit tests.
Since network code is abstracted by interfaces, unit-tests may use fake
implementations which transmit messages in memory and inject failures
arbitrarily.
Additionally, users of the Ghoul library may, for example, connect
\texttt{KademliaRoutingImpl} with their own network code.
Both \texttt{KademliaRoutingImpl} and \texttt{KademliaStore} rely on abstract
interfaces: \texttt{MessageSender} and \texttt{MessageListener}, which are used
to send and receive messages (objects that are subclasses of
the \texttt{KademliaMessage} class).
Implementations of those message communication classes rely on more basic
interfaces, respectively: \texttt{ByteSender} and \texttt{ByteListeningService},
which operate on packets of bytes.
Ghoul provides an UDP-based implementation, but if a library's user wants a
different protocol, then the user may easily provide her own implementation, as
long as the protocol can send byte messages. 
\texttt{NetworkAddressDiscovery} is used for discovering current node's
external address.
As this is tricky to do (a common example is a user behind NAT), implementation
of the address discovery interface may be changed to suit particular use-case.

Large number of parameters is sometimes considered a code smell, but dependency
inversion is a more important consideration in this case.
Additionally, a builder design pattern is used for creating instances of
\texttt{KademliaRouting}.
Implemented by \texttt{KademliaRoutingBuilder}, the builder allows for iterative
creation of \texttt{KademliaRoutingImpl} by using fluid setter methods, e.g.
\texttt{builder.setBucketSize(size).setCertificateStorage(storage).build()}.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
\begin{lstlisting}
KademliaRoutingImpl(Key localKey,
                    NetworkAddressDiscovery networkAddressDiscovery,
                    MessageSender sender,
                    ListeningService listeningService,
                    int bucketSize,
                    int alpha,
                    Collection<NodeInfo> initialKnownPeers,
                    long messageTimeout,
                    TimeUnit messageTimeoutUnit,
                    long heartBeatDelay,
                    TimeUnit heartBeatDelayUnit,
                    PersonalCertificateManager personalCertificateManager,
                    CertificateStorage certificateStorage,
                    PrivateKey personalPrivateKey,
                    ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutor,
                    Random random);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Security part}

An UML class diagram showing core classes of the security part of Ghoul is shown
in Figure \ref{fig:dht_class_diagram}.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centering
  \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{\input{SecurityClassDiagram.pdf_tex}}
\caption{UML Class Diagram of core classes of the security part of Ghoul}
\label{fig:sec_class_diagram}
\end{figure}

The \texttt{Registrar} class implements the registration authority
responsibilities.
Objects of this class depend on the list of other registrar's.
Public information about a registrar is enclosed in the
\texttt{RegistrarDescription} class, which contains the public key and the IP
address of the registrar.
A \texttt{Registrar} listens for TCP connections and starts the key generation
protocol if a client node wants to join the network (the join protocol itself is
done by the \texttt{KeyGenerationProtocol} class), or relays messages from other
registrars.
The registrar contacted by a client sends a collection
\texttt{SignedCertificate}s upon successful execution of the key generation
protocol.
The \texttt{SignedCertificate} class is a decorator of the \texttt{Certificate}
class that adds a signature to otherwise unsigned certificate.
The \texttt{Certificate} itself is just a collection of node's public key,
node's DHT key, and issuing registrar's identification.

\texttt{CertificateStorage} is responsible for managing other nodes'
certificates.
That is, it keeps track of known certificates, especially their validity and
expiration date.
Objects which use \texttt{CertificateStorage} may check whether given node
is still valid or get a node's public key.
\texttt{PersonalCertificateManager} manager is responsible for keeping current
node's certificates valid.

\texttt{RegistrarClient} implements the join protocol from the client's node
perspective, returning signed certificates on success.

\texttt{KeyGenerator} generates public-key cryptography keys. 
Current implementation of \texttt{KeyGenerator} uses hard-coded SHA256WithDSA
algorithm, but we plan to make it configurable in the official public release.

\section{Building and running}
\label{sec:build}

\subsection{Gradle}
Currently Ghoul's code contains around 9000 lines of code in 126 Java files
(excluding dfuntest's project).
To maintain this amount of code we use
Gradle\footnote{\url{https://gradle.org/}} build automation framework.
In Gradle, developers write configuration scripts called \texttt{build.gradle}
in which they define code's properties --- e.g. name of the project, project's
dependencies; and build tasks.
Those configuration scripts are written in an imperative, Java-like, dynamically
typed language.
This language allows for expressive and succinct definition of build tasks,
which is an advantage over more traditional build framework --- Maven
\footnote{\url{https://maven.apache.org/}}.
Next, using provided information, Gradle performs, typical tasks in Java's build
ecosystem: compilation, packaging, dependency resolution, unit testing, software
validation etc.
Gradle allows developers to download and build Ghoul in two simple steps:
download the software from GitHub and run build task in Gradle (shown in Figure
\ref{fig:ghoul_build_process})

\end{figure}

We have added additional automatic code quality checking tools to Ghoul's automatic build:

\begin{description}
  \item{\textbf{jUnit}\footnote{\url{http://junit.org}}} 
    jUnit is the framework for writing repeatable unit tests for Java code.
  \item{\textbf{JaCoCo}\footnote{\url{www.eclemma.org/jacoco/}}}
    JaCoCo is a code coverage library which automatically analyzes code executed by jUnit tests and produces an HTML or XML report summarizing code coverage.

  \item{\textbf{PMD}\footnote{\url{http://pmd.sourceforge.net}}}
    PMD is a source code analyzer.
    It finds common programming flaws like unused variables, empty catch blocks, unnecessary object creation etc.
  \item{\textbf{Findbugs}\footnote{\url{http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/}}}
    Findbugs is a static analysis tools which looks for bugs in Java's code.
    It can detect such bugs and code smells as: unused variables, null value
    dereference, use of \texttt{AtomicBoolean} for comparison etc.
    
\end{description}

We haven't included dfuntest's test into the automatic build, because this is a
long task.
However dfuntest's testing suite is always run manually before committing to git
repository to confirm code's correctness.

\subsection{Usage}

Although Ghoul is mainly designed to be used as a library, it is also possible
to run it as a standalone application.
In standalone mode Ghoul additionally exposes an RPC-over-HTTP interface over
which it is possible to query and manipulate the DHT node (shown in Table
\ref{tab:http_rpc}).

\begin{table}[tbp]
  \begin{tabular}{|c|p{3cm}|p{3.6cm}|p{3.4cm}|}
    \hline
    HTTP-RPC & Arguments & Response & Description \\
    \hline
    \texttt{START} & None & Plain HTTP & Start Kademlia service.\\
    \hline
    \texttt{STOP} & None & Plain HTTP  & Stop Kademlia service.\\
    \hline
    \texttt{SHUT\_DOWN} & None & Plain HTTP &
      Shutdown the entire application after returning this call.\\
    \hline
    \texttt{FIND\_NODES} & Kademlia key & JSON list of key-ip pairs &
      Find Kademlia's neighbors close to given key.\\
    \hline
    \texttt{GET\_ROUTING\_TABLE} & None & JSON list of key-ip pairs & Return
      Kademlia node's neighbors present in its routing table.\\
    \hline
    \texttt{GET\_KEY} & None & String representing the key & Return callee's
      Kademlia ke.y\\
    \hline
    \texttt{GET} & Kademlia key  & JSON list of binary data & Get instances of
    data stored under given key. \\
    \hline
    \texttt{PUT} & Kademlia key and binary data  & Plain HTTP & Store given
    key-data pair in Kademlia. \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{RPC-over-HTTP interface of Ghoul application}
  \label{tab:http_rpc}
\end{table}

An example session which runs 2 registrars and 3 DHT nodes is shown in Figures 
\ref{fig:ghoul_manual_run} and \ref{fig:ghoul_manipulation}.
In the session we use curl to send RPC-over-HTTP queries to DHT nodes.
First, we start registrars (Lines 1--2) and then DHT nodes (Lines 3--8).
Afterwards we get routing tables of the second DHT node (Line 9).
Then we contact the first to node to put \texttt{DATA} string under the key
\texttt{100} (Line 10).
Later, we ask the third node to get all values of the data under key
\texttt{100} stored by replicas (Line 11).
The data returned is the \texttt{DATA} string encoded with BASE64 encoding.
